# Safe Food Brands
It is unsafe for Riley to eat foods containing peanuts or tree nuts, as well as foods processed in facilities with peanuts and/or tree nuts. The FDA does not require companies to label products that are processed in facilities with allergens. The law only requires brands to label if the product contains one of the top 8 allergens. 

Below is a list of brands who do include production process information on their labels or we have confirmed are safe. Some brands only include processing information for products with the chance of cross-contact. The best brands include information about products that contain allergens, are produced in facilities with allergens, <b>and</b> those produced free from allergens. Please support these brands!

NOTE: Brands can change their production process at any time. It is important to always check labels, even for foods you have purchased previously.
